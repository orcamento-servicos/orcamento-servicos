"""
DEPRECATED: this simple `src/user.py` module was used for quick tests.
The project uses `src/models/models.py` (SQLAlchemy models) and this file
is not referenced by the application. Keep it only temporarily; it can be
removed safely in a later cleanup once CI confirms no references remain.

If you want it deleted now, tell me and I'll remove this file from the repo.
